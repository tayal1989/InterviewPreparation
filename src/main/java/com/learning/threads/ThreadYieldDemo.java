/*
* If line 1 is commented then both main and child thread will have same priority.
* However, chances of completing main thread 1 increases as we are introducing 
* yield() method.
* 
* If line is not commented then child method has priority 2 and main method has 
* priority 5 so 100% chance is that main method will be completed first.
